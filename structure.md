## 简介

Django 默认的目录结构意在为构建不同大小的应用提供一个好的起点，当然，你可以自己按照喜好组织应用目录结构。

## 创建你的应用程序

现在你的环境 - 一个“项目” - 已经设置，你将开始做工作。

您在Django中编写的每个应用程序都包含遵循特定约定的Python包。Django提供了一个自动生成应用程序的基本目录结构的实用程序，所以您可以专注于编写代码，而不是创建目录

> **项目与应用程序**
> 项目和应用程序之间有什么区别？应用程序是一个执行某些操作的Web应用程序 - 例如Weblog系统，公共记录数据库或简单的轮询应用程序。项目是特定网站的配置和应用程序的集合。项目可以包含多个应用程序。应用程序可以在多个项目中。

要创建您的应用程序，请确保您位于相同的目录中，manage.py 然后键入以下命令：

    python manage.py startapp app

这将创建一个目录app，其目录结构如下：

    app/ 
        migrations/
            __init__.py
        __init__.py 
        admin.py 
        models.py 
        tests.py
        views.py

Django 对类在何处被加载没有任何限制 -- 只要 站点目录的 `settings.py`的 `INSTALLED_APPS` 载入它们即可。

#### 页面模版目录在哪里?

When getting started with Laravel, many developers are confused by the lack of a `models` directory. However, the lack of such a directory is intentional. We find the word "models" ambiguous since it means many different things to many different people. Some developers refer to an application's "model" as the totality of all of its business logic, while others refer to "models" as classes that interact with a relational database.

For this reason, we choose to place Eloquent models in the `app` directory by default, and allow the developer to place them somewhere else if they choose.

## 根目录

<a name="the-root-app-directory"></a>
#### App文件夹

The `app` directory, as you might expect, contains the core code of your application. We'll explore this directory in more detail soon; however, almost all of the classes in your application will be in this directory.

#### manage.py文件

The `bootstrap` directory contains files that bootstrap the framework and configure autoloading. This directory also houses a `cache` directory which contains framework generated files for performance optimization such as the route and services cache files.

<a name="the-app-directory"></a>
## App目录

The majority of your application is housed in the `app` directory. By default, this directory is namespaced under `App` and is autoloaded by Composer using the [PSR-4 autoloading standard](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/).

The `app` directory contains a variety of additional directories such as `Console`, `Http`, and `Providers`. Think of the `Console` and `Http` directories as providing an API into the core of your application. The HTTP protocol and CLI are both mechanisms to interact with your application, but do not actually contain application logic. In other words, they are simply two ways of issuing commands to your application. The `Console` directory contains all of your Artisan commands, while the `Http` directory contains your controllers, middleware, and requests.

A variety of other directories will be generated inside the `app` directory as you use the `make` Artisan commands to generate classes. So, for example, the `app/Jobs` directory will not exist until you execute the `make:job` Artisan command to generate a job class.

> {tip} Many of the classes in the `app` directory can be generated by Artisan via commands. To review the available commands, run the `php artisan list make` command in your terminal.

#### The Console Directory

The `Console` directory contains all of the custom Artisan commands for your application. These commands may be generated using the `make:command` command. This directory also houses your console kernel, which is where your custom Artisan commands are registered and your [scheduled tasks](/docs/{{version}}/scheduling) are defined.
